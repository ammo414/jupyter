# Jupyter

## Consumption+Leisure
A sample of scientific computing/exploratory visualization for advanced macroeconomic theory regarding trade offs between consumption and lesure

## File Change Semantics
A NLP project to implement semantic parser based off a classical semantic theory known as File Change Semantics. Some sample sentences are analyzed and parsed, and applications to cognitive science are discussed especially with regards to algorithm efficiency analysis.

## Mortality Rates
A linear regression is performed on the mortality rates across US states by looking at various independent variables: adult obesity rates, opiod sales, political leaning, and average age. While largely cross sectional, a panel data approach is glanced upon by comparing 2016 and 2008 data to see if the same variables are equally powerful explaners a decade later. Some basic visualization in matplotlib is also included.

## Rutgers Class Types
As the pandemic wore on, hybrid and in-person classes were becoming more popular again at Rutgers. But different departments offered in-person classes at different rates. This scraped and visualized data from Rutgers's Schedule of Classes to see how different departments responded to the pandemic.
