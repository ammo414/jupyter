Repository of my python notebooks. Consists of data analysis and scientific computing work

## Consumption+Leisure
A sample of scientific computing/exploratory visualization for advanced macroeconomic theory regarding trade offs between consumption and leisure. In short, how should consumers optimally split their time between working (for the sake of consuming their income on goods and savings) and rest, or leisure?

## File Change Semantics
A NLP project to implement a semantic parser based off of a classical semantic theory known as File Change Semantics. Some sample sentences are analyzed and parsed, and applications to cognitive science are discussed especially with regards to algorithm efficiency analysis.

## Mortality Rates
A linear regression is performed on the mortality rates across US states by looking at various independent variables: adult obesity rates, opiod sales, political leaning, and average age. While largely cross sectional, a panel data analysis is glanced upon by comparing 2016 and 2008 data to see if the same variables are equally powerful explaners a decade prior. Some matplotlib visualizations are also included.

## Rutgers Class Types
As the pandemic wore on, hybrid and in-person classes were becoming more popular again at Rutgers. But different departments offered in-person classes at different rates. This scraped and visualized data from Rutgers's Schedule of Classes to see how different departments responded to the pandemic.
